# Kubernetes Deployment - Placeholder
#
# This directory is reserved for Kubernetes deployment manifests.
# The following files would typically be added here:
#
# - deployment.yaml     - API deployment configuration
# - service.yaml        - Service exposing the API
# - configmap.yaml      - Non-sensitive configuration
# - secret.yaml         - Sensitive configuration (template only)
# - ingress.yaml        - Ingress rules for external access
# - hpa.yaml            - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
# - pdb.yaml            - Pod Disruption Budget
#
# For now, use Docker Compose for deployment.
# Kubernetes manifests will be added when scaling requirements change.
